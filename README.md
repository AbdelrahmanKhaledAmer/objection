# Objection Programming Language

This repository contains the description of a programming language that I am designing and implementing called objection. For more on the description of the language, see the [language specification file here](language.md). This file has the basic description, but it will be updated as the language is developed and I learn more about what I want to do with it.

Another markdown file will contain [the grammar that is currently under development](grammar.md), and will also be updated (albeit more frequently) as the language is developed.

Additionally, I will have an [examples folder](./ex) that will contain example code written in the language.

Finally, the compiler for this language will be written in rust. I have no experience with rust, so this will be another challenge for me.
